## Abstract

The `gtrends_compare_terms.R` script takes a list of search terms in `input/search_terms.txt`
and generates a Google Trends index rescaled in 0 and 1000.
The tool overcomes the limitation of Google Trends to 5 terms, supporting an arbitrary
number of terms.

The results are written in CSV format in the `output` folder.
